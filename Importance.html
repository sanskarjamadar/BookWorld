<h1>Importance of Books</h1>
<p>Books play a significant role in our life. They say that “When you open a book, you open a new world”. I believe that everyone would agree with this statement as books have become inevitable to mankind. For the majority of people, books are part of their everyday life.  A book is like a best friend who will never walk away from you.Books are packed with knowledge, insights into a happy life, life lessons, love, fear, prayer and helpful advice. One can read about anything under the sun. Books have been here for centuries and without them today’s knowledge of our past ancestors, cultures and civilizations would have been impossible. Have you ever thought what would have happened if intellectuals never documented their studies?On the 23rd of April the world celebrates the World Book Day. This day is a celebration of authors, illustrators, books and most importantly reading. The main aim of the World Book Day is to encourage children to the pleasures of books and reading. The reason for choosing this particular date is interesting. The 23rd of April is a symbolic date for world literature because it is the date of death for many great authors and poets such as William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes, William Wordsworth and many others.In my opinion reading is the perfect hobby and I am sure that a lot of people would agree.</p>
<p>A book communicates knowledge, and not only knowledge but wisdom of all kinds. They say that “The more you read, the more well-read you are”. In simple terms what this means is that the more you read the more exposed you are, your attitudes, your ideas and your imagination changes. I believe that my personality, behaviour, ideas and knowledge are all built on the books I have read. Nothing can add to our intellect more than reading a book.They shape our beliefs, values, and attitudes.  They broaden our perspectives on politics, love, and money.  They show us how to get out of the doldrums and change our lives forever.  They improve the way our minds and memories function, and they can be endlessly entertaining.Books also help us explore our interest. Every subject does not interest every person. People have their personal interests and liking. However, till the time we do not learn about a particular subject we wouldn’t be able to know whether it is of our interest or not. The best way to find out where our interest lies is by reading about numerous subjects. Books help us explore our interest. The more subjects we read the more we will understand, what really holds our interest. It is thus particularly important for the students to read different kinds of books as this would help them identify where their interest lies. This goes a long way in choosing their career path.Books do not only kill boredom and enhance our knowledge and creativity they are also excellent when it comes to seeking advice. There are numerous self help and motivational books that help and guide us in the right direction. Whenever we are faced with a tough situation, it is best to read such books to understand how to act wisely. Here, you will get an advice from highly learned people who have explored life deeply. It is much better than taking advice from random relatives and friends. Many people have improved their life by reading such books. Just like a best friend, such books guide us to follow the right path.</p>
