        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>The history of books starts with the development of writing, and various other inventions such as paper and printing, and continues through to the modern day business of book printing. The earliest history of books actually predates what would conventionally be called "books" today and begins with tablets, scrolls, and sheets of papyrus. Then hand-bound, expensive, and elaborate books known as codices appeared. These gave way to press-printed volumes and eventually lead to the mass printed tomes prevalent today. Contemporary books may even have no physical presence with the advent of the e-book. The book also became more accessible to the disabled with the advent of Braille and spoken books.</p><br><hr>
        <h2>Clay tablets</h2><hr>
        <p>Clay tablets were used in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. The calamus, an instrument in the form of a triangle, was used to make characters in moist clay. People used to use fire to dry the tablets out. At Nineveh, over 20,000 tablets were found, dating from the 7th century BC; this was the archive and library of the kings of Assyria, who had workshops of copyists and conservationists at their disposal. This presupposes a degree of organization with respect to books, consideration given to conservation, classification, etc. Tablets were used right up until the 19th century in various parts of the world, including Germany, Chile, Philippines and the Saharan Desert.</p>
        <h3>Cuneiform and Sumerian Writing</h3>
        <p>Writing originated as a form of record keeping in Sumer during the fourth millennium BCE with the advent of cuneiform. Many clay tablets have been found that show cuneiform writing used to record legal contracts, create lists of assets, and eventually to record Sumerian literature and myths. Scribal schools have been found by archaeologists from as early as the second millennium BCE where students were taught the art of writing

        <h2>Papyrus</h2><hr>
        <p>After extracting the marrow from the stems of Papyrus reed, a series of steps (humidification, pressing, drying, gluing, and cutting) produced media of variable quality, the best being used for sacred writing. In Ancient Egypt, papyrus was used as a medium for writing surfaces, maybe as early as from First Dynasty, but first evidence is from the account books of King Neferirkare Kakai of the Fifth Dynasty (about 2400 BC). A calamus, the stem of a reed sharpened to a point, or bird feathers were used for writing. The script of Egyptian scribes was called hieratic, or sacerdotal writing; it is not hieroglyphic, but a simplified form more adapted to manuscript writing (hieroglyphs usually being engraved or painted). Egyptians exported papyrus to other Mediterranean civilizations including Greece and Rome where it was used until parchment was developed.
          Papyrus books were in the form of a scroll of several sheets pasted together, for a total length of 10 meters or more. Some books, such as the history of the reign of Ramses III, were over 40 meters long. Books rolled out horizontally; the text occupied one side, and was divided into columns. The title was indicated by a label attached to the cylinder containing the book. Many papyrus texts come from tombs, where prayers and sacred texts were deposited (such as the Book of the Dead, from the early 2nd millennium BC).

        <h2>Wax Tablets</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Romans used wax-coated wooden tablets or pugillares upon which they could write and erase by using a stylus. One end of the stylus was pointed, and the other was spherical. Usually these tablets were used for everyday purposes (accounting, notes) and for teaching writing to children, according to the methods discussed by Quintilian in his Institutio Oratoria X Chapter 3. Several of these tablets could be assembled in a form similar to a codex. Also the etymology of the word codex (block of wood) suggest that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.</p>

        <h2> Book Culture</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The authors of Antiquity had no rights concerning their published works; there were neither authors' nor publishing rights. Anyone could have a text recopied, and even alter its contents. Scribes earned money and authors earned mostly glory, unless a patron provided cash; a book made its author famous. This followed the traditional conception of the culture: an author stuck to several models, which he imitated and attempted to improve. The status of the author was not regarded as absolutely personal.
               From a political and religious point of view, books were censored very early: the works of Protagoras were burned because he was a proponent of agnosticism and argued that one could not know whether or not the gods existed. Generally, cultural conflicts led to important periods of book destruction: in 303, the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of Christian texts. Some Christians later burned libraries, and especially heretical or non-canonical Christian texts. These practices are found throughout human history but have ended in many nations today. A few nations today still greatly censor and even burn books.
               But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty. It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor Augustus, who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors. This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power. However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.</p>

        <h2> Parchment</h2>
          <hr>
        <p>Parchment, a thin material that is made from calfskin, sheepskin or even goatskin was first developed as a substitute to Papyrus. Herodotus, the Greek historian who lived in the 5th century BC (regarded as the "Father of History" in Western culture) described the use of skins to write on as common in his time. According to the Roman Varro (a scholar and writer who lived 116BC - 27BC) parchment was invented under the patronage of Eumenes of Pergamum (an ancient Greek city in modern-day Turkey) due to shortages of Papyrus.
               Parchment itself derives it's name from the city of Pergamon (the same Greek city as Pergamum) and it is known to have been perfected here. After a great library was setup in Pergamon (that rivalled the Library of Alexandria) prices began rising for the price of papyrus (partly due to the increasing scarcity of the papyrus reeds as it was overfarmed) leading to the adoption of parchment as the main writing material.
               Parchment is distinct from leather in that it is limed (soaked in an Alkali solution which removed the hairs on the skin) but not tanned. As such parchment reacts with changes in humidity (being partly hydroscopic) and is not waterproof. The finer quality parchments are known as vellum and even in the modern age parchment has been called the "finest writing material ever devised" with even the most modern papers not reaching the quality of the finest vellum.

        <h2>Block Printing in Egypt</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Block printing (called Tarsh in Arabic) arrived in Egypt around this time, although it is unclear if this was developed separately or influenced by the block printing already in use in Asia (although Arabic chronicles confirm that paper making in Egypt was developed from Central Asia). This block printing method appears to be almost exclusively used by the Muslim community.
         Most surviving extant prints suggest that block printing was mainly restricted to religious texts such as amulets (long thin strips of paper bearing quotes from the Quran, listing the names of God and other texts designed to ward off evil). These "amulets" were rolled into metal tubes and worn around the neck on a chain.
         It is unknown why block printing never developed within Egypt, or the Muslim community but it is thought that this may be due to the fact that Tarsh was used by Itinerant tinners, rogue scribes (such as Abu Dulaf al-Khazraji who frenquented the courts of Iranian Buyid princes and has written of the Tarsh process) and other confidence men who could take advantage of the piety of the gullible masses. This would explain it's insulation from the rest of society and why the technology was never expanded upon.</p>

         <h2>The First Printed Book</h2>
         <p>The very first book is printed on paper in China, using a block of wood that had characters carved in reverse relief. Ink was then placed on the block of wood to create a print on paper.
                This technique is known as "block printing" or more accurately in this case "woodblock printing" and was originally used as early as 220 AD as a means of printing on cloth.
                A block of wood is carefully prepared with a knife, chisel or sandpaper along the grain of the wood as a "relief matrix", so that the raised areas are the black type. The content has to be created in reverse so that when printed it forms the mirror image. This process of carving the wood is known as Xylography.
                Block printing could even be done in colour, by using multiple blocks (one block for each colour), although overprinting two colours can produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.</p>
